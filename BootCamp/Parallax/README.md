# Parallax Website Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a parallax scrolling effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The parallax effect creates a visually appealing and dynamic user experience by making the background images move at a different speed than the foreground content. The website also includes buttons for navigation between sections and a "Back to Top" button for easy navigation.

## Features
- **Parallax Scrolling:** Smooth parallax effect on background images across multiple sections.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Scrolls smoothly to different sections when buttons are clicked.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, including disabling the parallax effect on smaller screens.
- **Interactive Elements:** Buttons that navigate through sections and a "Back to Top" button for better user experience.
- **Hover Effects:** Slight scaling of content sections on hover for a more interactive feel.

## File Structure
- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file with styles for the parallax sections, content sections, buttons, and responsiveness.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Mystify7777/CyberCell/new/main/BootCamp/Parallax
     ```

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the website.

3. **Customize:**
   - Customize the content, background images, and styles as per your requirements. Background images can be replaced by updating the URLs in the `styles.css` file.

## Customization Guide
- **Changing Background Images:**
  - Update the `background-image` property in `styles.css` for each parallax section:
    ```css
    #parallax1 {
        background-image: url('path/to/your/image.jpg');
    }
    ```

- **Adjusting Scroll Behavior:**
  - Scroll behavior is controlled using the `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in CSS and JavaScript functions to handle section navigation.

- **Modifying Button Placement:**
  - Buttons can be repositioned within each section by adjusting their CSS properties or moving them within the HTML structure.
